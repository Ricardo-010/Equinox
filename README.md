Project: Equinox
Overview
The project "Equinox" aims to provide support during the COVID-19 quarantine. This application bridges the gap between patients seeking counselling and qualified counsellors. It features a user-friendly interface for both patients and counsellors to register and log in, facilitating an efficient matching process based on the issues patients need help with and the problems counsellors are equipped to handle.

Features:
  Welcome Page
    First Interaction: Users are greeted with options to either log in or register.
    Role Selection: Users choose their role (patient or counsellor) at this stage.
    
  Registration Process
